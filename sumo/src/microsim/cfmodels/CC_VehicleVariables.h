     * we expect to get from the upper application the data that the CACC needs, i.e.:
     * - front distance, front speed and front vehicle acceleration: this information
     *   regards the car that the vehicle joining the platoon will have directly in
     *   front. this data might be real or might be fake: for example, if the platoon
     *   management algorithm decides to set the vehicle as the new leader, there won't
     *   be a car in front, and the fake data will be used only for positioning. in the
     *   case of fake data, acceleration must be set to 0
     * - leader front speed and acceleration: this information is the same as previously
     *   described for vehicle in front, but regards the leader. again, if the vehicle
     *   is being set as the new leader, this data might be fake data
